                        <h5><strong>Motivation</strong></h5>
                        <p>Businesses are often tempted to boost their reputation online by creating fake accounts and posting fake reviews on websites such as Yelp and Glassdoor. Being able to filter unhelpful or false accounts (aka. is the user “useful” or not) would allow business reviews to reflect the opinions of clients accurately.</p>

                        <h5><strong>Training / Test Method</strong></h5>
                        <p>Attributes included from the Yelp dataset for each user include user account age, average star rating, number of reviews, number of friends, whether the user has elite status, total funny votes, and total cool votes. The total funny votes and total cool votes were very highly correlated with our target attribute and are attributes that require input from other users, so we had two categories for testing: Testing that included those two attributes (inclusive) and testing that did not use those attributes (exclusive).</p>
                        <p>In total, there are two sets of attributes and two definitions for our target attribute, giving us 4 categories:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>inclusive and 1 useful vote per review to be “useful” (threshold 1)
</li>
                            <li>inclusive and 2 useful votes per review to be “useful” (threshold 2)
</li>
                            <li>exclusive and threshold 1</li>
                            <li>exclusive and threshold 2</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In addition to attributes that the Yelp dataset provided, we also added attributes using natural language processing on user reviews such as average review length and average swears per review.</p>
                        
                        <h5><strong>Results</strong></h5>
                        <p>We trained against 5 main models - ZeroR, J48 Decision Tree, Decision Table, Bayes Net, Naive Bayes, and IBk Nearest Neighbour. Out of these, J48 and Bayes Net proved to perform the best on the training data, hence these were the models we used against the validation set. It turned out that J48 was the best fit (75% training and 65% validation) - IBk had been overfitting of the data with roughly 57% accuracy on the validation set.</p>
                        <p>In terms of including community provided information, the number of funny votes and the review count of the user seemed to provide the highest information gain. For an investigation excluding community provided information, the total number of a user’s reviews and how long it had been since the user had made the account seemed to be the attributes of highest information gain.</p>
